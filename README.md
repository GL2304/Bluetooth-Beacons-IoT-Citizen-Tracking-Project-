# Internet-of-Things Privacy and Security: Citizen Tracking in Public Spaces
Most businesses track consumers for user engagement and marketing, yet donâ€™t explicitly say so. 

While some forms of consumer tracking such as surveillance cameras and tracking cookies are widely known, many of us are unaware that enterprises use additional, obscure technologies and third party apps to track their consumers in private and public spaces without their knowledge or apparent consent. This raises privacy concerns as little is known about the extent of such data collection, the technologies used and the use of the data. 

This work focuses on researching and investigating consumer tracking in public spaces through the use of one such technology - Bluetooth Beacons, that are now widely employed by retail enterprises but remain unknown and undetectable to the general public. 

By gaining a firm understanding of the technology and using a modified open-source app for detecting beacons, we aim to build a beacon database for NYC, for the purpose of gaining insights on the participating companies, third party vendors and their privacy policies. With this work we intend to raise awareness regarding the issue in order to help push for reforms in data-sharing regulations, thus making data collection processes more transparent.
